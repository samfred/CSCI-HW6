A. Going down the lone on the left side of the file, there are listed character strings that, if found, are converted into new characters. If characters are listed on their own like with "an", they are converted to the other side's characters no matter what ("un"). If there is is the condition {WC}, the translation only occurs if the option is found by itself such as "A"/{WC}. If the line starts with <INW>, the following translation only occurs if the option is found in a word and the reverse <NIW> happens if the option is not found in a word.

B. See "textingLingo.l"
